# Java Tank Project

## Project Overview

This is a Tank game written in Java, showcasing the use of Java threads and object-oriented programming principles. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in multithreaded programming and object-oriented design, providing a simple yet engaging tank battle game.

## Project Features

- **Multithreaded Programming:** The project leverages Java's threading mechanisms to implement multiple tanks and other game elements running concurrently.

- **Object-Oriented Design:** Using object-oriented design principles, different elements of the game are abstracted as objects, resulting in a clear, understandable, and extensible code structure.

- **Game Logic:** Basic tank game logic is implemented, including tank movement, shooting, collision detection, and more.
